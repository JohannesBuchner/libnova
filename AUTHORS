BugFixes
========

20020103
	- src/transform.c in get_hrz_from_equ ()

	Algorithm changed to one, which use atan2 instead of atan function
	and thus returns 0..2PI for Azimuth instead of -pi/2..pi/2

	- src/julian_day.c in get_julian_day ()
	
	Correct check for 4th October 1582 (Julian/Gregorian calendar)

	Petr Kubanek <petr@lascaux.asu.cas.cz>

20022911 - src/julian_day.c in get_timet_from_julian ()
	
	Spurious errors were caused by loctime.tm_isdst not
	being initialised to 0.  
	
	Fix supplied by Petr Kubanek
